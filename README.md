## This is a MERN ToDo Project üòä
It was the bigggest project I have taken and it was tough as I had to think like a full stack developer. 

### How to setup üñ•Ô∏è
1. Start the server by using server.js file in server folder and node server.js
2. Provide your keys in env file
3. In the client folder type npm install and then npm start 
4. The app will start on sign up page.
